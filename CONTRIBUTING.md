# Contributing to TrustOS Plugin

We love your input! We want to make contributing to TrustOS Plugin as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Make your changes and ensure the code follows our style guide
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Create a pull request

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await for asynchronous code

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test your changes in development mode
- Check for TypeScript errors

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation if you're changing functionality
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of a maintainer

## Report Issues

Report issues using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/BTheCoderr/TOS/issues)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)
